# Video Game Sales and Engagement Analysis 🎮📊

### **Project Overview**

This project addresses a major industry challenge: understanding how player engagement (ratings, wishlists, and plays) directly translates into commercial success. By integrating fragmented sales data with user sentiment metrics, this analysis moves beyond simple reporting to uncover the behavioral drivers behind high-performing titles.

### **Key Problem Solved**

* **Data Fragmentation:** Unified separate sales and engagement datasets into a single analytical model to bridge the gap between commercial impact and player sentiment.
* **Predictive Insights:** Identified that "Wishlists" and "Plays" are stronger lead indicators of global revenue than critical ratings alone.

### **Business Objectives**

* Enable **data-driven decision-making** for marketing, game development, and sales planning.
* Identify high-growth genres and regions to optimize resource allocation and maximize ROI.
* Mitigate the risk of "one-size-fits-all" global launches by uncovering regional player preferences.

### **Tech Stack**

* **Python:** Data cleaning, standardization, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, and `Seaborn`.
* **SQL:** Scalable data management and normalization in a structured database environment.
* **Power BI:** Interactive dashboards featuring regional sales heatmaps, trend analysis, and engagement-sales correlations.

### **Key Findings & Recommendations**

1. **Strategic Focus:** High-performing markets like North America and Europe remain top revenue drivers, specifically for **Action and Sports** genres.
2. **The Success Formula:** While ratings build brand prestige, **Engagement Metrics** are the most reliable predictors of financial success.
3. **Platform Synergy:** Leveraging platform reputation (e.g., PlayStation for high-fidelity titles vs. Switch for high-volume engagement) acts as a strategic multiplier for sales.
